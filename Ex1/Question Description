A travel company needs you to develop a script that can help them decide the price of their tickets. The company want the script to work in accordance with the following three steps:

Chose a ticket type
The first thing the user of the script shall do is to select a ticket type using a menu looking like this:

Ticket types:
1. Budget  ( 500kr)
2. Economy ( 750kr)
3. VIP     (2000kr)


Menu for optional purchases
Next, the user shall be presented with a menu where he or she can select what to include in the ticket. The user shall be able to add a bag (max 1) or a meal (max 1). The user shall also be able to remove already added bags or meals. Finally the user shall be able to finalize the ticket. Above the menu the script shall display if a bag and/or meal has been selected. The company wants the menu to look like this:

Currently you have:
    0 bag(s) registered
    0 meal(s) registered

Here are your options:
1. Add bag (max 1)
2. Add meal (max 1)
3. Remove bag
4. Remove meal
5. Finalize ticket


Finalizing the ticket
When the user selects to finalize the ticket the script shall calculate the price of the ticket and any optional purchases according to the following price list:

Budget ticket = 500kr

Economy ticket = 750kr

VIP = 2000kr

Bag included = 200kr

Meal included = 150kr

The travel company insists that the last output shall look like an actual receipt and they require it to formatted exactly as can be seen in the examples below. The Bag and/or Meal parts of the receipt shall only show up if they have been selected.

Example of a receipt with a VIP ticket, a bag, and a meal:

Receipt:
Ticket : 2000kr
Bag    :  200kr
Meal   :  150kr
        -------
Total  : 2350kr
Example of a receipt with only a Budget ticket:

Receipt:
Ticket :  500kr
        -------
Total  :  500kr
