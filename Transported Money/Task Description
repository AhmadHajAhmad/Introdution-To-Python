A local bank office often transports bags of money to and from their main office. They have asked you to develop a script that can help them know beforehand how many bags will fit in the truck transporting the money, and what the value of all the bags combined is.

The truck transporting the money bags can vary in size from transport to transport so the size must be read from the user each time running the script. If the user enters a volume less than 100L they shall be asked again until they give a volume larger than, or equal to, 100L.

After having read the size of the truck, the script shall calculate how many money bags of each size fits in the specified truck and display it on exactly the following format:

2 big bags
1 medium bags
0 small bags
The banks internal policy documents dictate that they must only use bags in three sizes (20L, 50L, and 80L) and that they must always use as many of the bigger bags as possible. Here is an example to illustrate this:

Truck size = 220L

1. How many big bags (80L) can we fit in 220L? Answer is 2.
   We now have 60L left in truck.

2. How many medium bags (50L) can we fit in the remaining 60L? Answer is 1.
   There is still 10L left in the truck.

3. How many small bags (20L) can we fit in the remaining 10L? Answer is 0.
   There is 10L left in the truck that we can not fit any bag into.
Having decided how many bags can be transported it is time to calculate how much the shipment is worth and display this information to the user. A small bag is worth 10000kr, a medium bag 30000kr, and a big bag is worth 60000kr. The following format must be used when printing the total value:

Total value: 150000kr
